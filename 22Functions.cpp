//A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
//You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
//Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

//Declaration: the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any)
//Definition: the body of the function (code to be executed)
